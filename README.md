This project combines modern web technologies with AI-powered logic to bring clarity and focus to your daily workload, whether for personal productivity or project management.

## Project Overview

PRISM uses the Eisenhower Matrix methodology and AI algorithms to organize tasks into four key quadrants:

- **Important & Urgent**
- **Important, Not Urgent**
